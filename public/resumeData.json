I primarily use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack when developing web applications. I also have experience developing web applications in python/django and ruby on rails, desktop applications in python and android apps in java.

          "I am currently performing full-stack development of a Telstra enterprise web application with at least 500 internal users utilizing the MERN stack. The primary feature of this application is a user-browsable catalogue of charts displaying data that is regularly queried from their sources. My team and I are also building new features everyday, such as the ability to allow users to query databases from within the application, run user-written scripts and schedule them from within the application to query and validate data from desired databases, and many more. The application is also using a microservices architecture to integrate 6 disparate web apps (and more overtime) into a single one-stop shop which is being deployed on AWS.",
