# Still in progress, github pages and codesandbox link will be available upon completion.

## Description

This is my portfolio website. I have placed
Tim Baker's react resume template (https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template) inside a create-react-app template then built on top of it to create this.

## New Features I've Added (still in progress):

- Activated the previously static download resume button so that when clicked, a pdf resume is downloaded.
- Activated the previously static contact form at the bottom to send an email
  to the website owner.

## To take my portfolio website and change it/build on top of it to suit your needs:

### 1. Set up and run the application.

### `git clone https://github.com/AVu120/portfolio-website.git`

### `cd portfolio-website`

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

Then open http://localhost:3000 in a browser.

<em>The development server started by `npm start` will automatically reload the page whenever a code change is made.</em>

### 2. Replace styles and images.

Replace the styles inside public/css and the images inside public/images with your own. <em>Note: YOU MUST KEEP THE SAME NAMES ON THE IMAGES.</em>

### 3. Fill in your personal info

To populate the website with all of your own data, open the public/resumeData.json file and simply replace the data in there with your own.

### 4. Have fun!
